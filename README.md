# RESTful APIs in React | making HTTP requests (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

Using RESTful APIs in React involves making HTTP requests (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to communicate with a server to fetch or modify data. Typically, developers use libraries like fetch or axios to perform these requests within React components or hooks (e.g., useEffect). The retrieved data is then stored in component state (using useState) and rendered accordingly. This approach enables React applications to dynamically interact with backend services and create interactive, data-driven user interfaces.
